        <h2>The modern <em>Olympic</em> Games</h2>
        <p>
          The modern Olympic Games (OG; or Olympics; French: Jeux olympiques,
          JO)[a][1] are the world's leading international sporting events. They
          feature summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of
          athletes from around the world participate in a variety of
          competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost
          sports competition, with more than 200 teams, representing sovereign
          states and territories, participating. By default, the Games generally
          substitute for any world championships during the year in which they
          take place (however, each class usually maintains its own records).[2]
          The Olympic Games are held every four years. Since 1994, they have
          alternated between the Summer and Winter Olympics every two years
          during the four-year Olympiad.
