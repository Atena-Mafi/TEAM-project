        <h2>Swimming World</h2>
        Swimming started its sporting journey in the mid-19th century, when the
        world's first swimming organisation was formed in London in 1837.
        Inevitably, things soon became competitive and, in 1846, the first
        swimming championship was held in Australia. The race became an annual
        event, and it was an early indicator for the future success of
        competitive swimming. Swimming has been part of the Olympic schedule
        since the very first modern Olympic Games in 1896. It's one of only four
        disciplines to have been retained, appearing in every summer Olympics
        since - the others being athletics, artistic gymnastics and fencing.The following events were contested (all pool events are long course, and distances are in meters unless stated)
