        <h2>Swimming World</h2>
        Swimming started its sporting journey in the mid-19th century, when the
        world's first swimming organisation was formed in London in 1837.
        Inevitably, things soon became competitive and, in 1846, the first
        swimming championship was held in Australia. The race became an annual
        event, and it was an early indicator for the future success of
        competitive swimming. Swimming has been part of the Olympic schedule
        since the very first modern Olympic Games in 1896. It's one of only four
        disciplines to have been retained, appearing in every summer Olympics
        since - the others being athletics, artistic gymnastics and fencing.The following events were contested (all pool events are long course, and distances are in meters unless stated)

        <h2>Birth of Olympic swimming</h2>
        In the early years, Olympic swimming events were male-only. Women's
        events were introduced at the 1912 Games in Stockholm - although women
        initially only competed in two events, the 100m freestyle and 4√ó100m
        freestyle relay. Experimental beginnings brought some rather unique
        events to those early Games. At the inaugural modern Olympics in Athens,
        swimming events included the
        <strong>100m freestyle for sailors</strong>, which only members of the
        Greek navy could compete in. Until the London 1908 Games, Olympic
        swimming events took place in open water. This left the swimmers at the
        mercy of the elements, contending with the weather and waves.
        <br />
        After being exposed to temperatures of 13¬∞C in the Mediterranean (a
        modern Olympic pool is around 25-28¬∞C) during the 1,200m freestyle race
        - in which he won gold - Alfr√©d Haj√≥s said: ‚ÄúMy will to live completely
        overcame my desire to win‚Äù, illustrating the precarious nature of the
        early swimming events. Showing just how varied the Games have been
        throughout history, Haj√≥s would later compete at the 1924 Paris Olympics
        in the art competition, when he and fellow countryman Dezs≈ë Lauber won
        silver in the sporting architecture category.
